Classic tic tac toe game developed during week 16 of MIT course in full stack development, MIT license in the files.
the project is developed using react. it still needs some improvements.
A visual effect when there is a winner, maybe some way to restart the game without refreshing.
There is a little logic bug that needs to be fixed when clicking again on a cell.
